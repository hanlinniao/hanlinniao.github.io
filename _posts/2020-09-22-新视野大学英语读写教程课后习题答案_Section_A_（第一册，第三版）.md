1. 孔子是中国历史上著名的思想家、教育家，是儒家学派（Confucianism）的创始人，被尊称为古代的"圣人"（sage）。他的言论和生平活动记录在《论语》（The Analects）一书中。《论语》是中国古代文化的经典著作，对后来历代的思想家、文学家、政治家产生了很大影响。不研究《论语》，就不能真正把握中国几千年的传统文化。孔子的很多思想，尤其是其教育思想，对中国社会产生了深远的影响。在21世纪的今天，孔子的学说不仅受到中国人的重视，而且也越来越受到整个国际社会的重视。

2. Confucius was a great thinker and educator in Chinese history. He was the founder of Confucianism and was respectfully referred to as an ancient "sage". His words and life story were recorded in The Analects. An enduring classic of ancient Chinese culture, The Analects has had a great influence on the thinkers, writers, and statesmen that came after Confucius. Without studying this book, one could hardly truly understand the thousands-of-years' traditional Chinese culture. Much of Confucius' thought, especially his thought on education, has had a profound influence on Chinese society. In the 21st century, Confucian thought not only retains the attention of the Chinese, but it also wins an increasing attention from the international community.

1. 间隔年指的是学生休假不去上学而去旅行或工作等的一段时间，但不一定是一年。间隔年通常选在高中毕业和进入大学之前的一段时间。在这段时间里，学生可以旅行、参加志愿者工作或是在国外边打工边度假。一种新潮流是参加语言学习、住家、文化交流、社区服务和自主学习于一体的国际教育活动。间隔年的做法于 20 世纪 60 年代兴起于英国。它在英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和加拿大已经变得非常流行。但是在美国，间隔年的做法仍然只是个别现象。不过近年来，间隔年对美国人来说变得稍微普遍起来。 2013 年有大约四万美国学生参加了间隔年活动，比 2006 年增加了近 20% 。普林斯顿大学、哈佛大学、麻省理工学院等大学都有明文规定允许学生延迟入学。

1. 在所有美国人的信念中，最基本、最强烈的信念可能就是崇尚个人自由。要理解美国人，最重要的也许就是了解他们对“个人主义”的热爱。生活中他们很早就开始受到教育，把自己看成独立的个体，对人生中自己的处境以及自己的前途命运负责。美国人认为自己的思想和行为高度个性化。他们不愿被视为任何同质群体的代表。如果确实加入了群体，他们也认为自己有特别之处，与同一个群体中的其他成员有着些许的差别。与美国人对个人主义赋予的价值紧密相关的是他们对个人隐私的重视。美国人认为，人“需要有自己的时间”或者“有时间独处”，用来思考事情，或者恢复他们所消耗的心理能量。美国人很难理解那些总想与人结伴、不爱独处的外国人。

2. Integrity and harmony are traditional Chinese virtues. “Harmony” is demonstrated in various aspects. In regard to interpersonal relations, traditional Chinese thoughts hold that “Harmony is most precious” and “A family that lives in harmony will prosper”. A harmonious social environment can be created based on these principles. As for relations between human beings and nature, people should learn to understand, respect and protect nature. Harmony is essential to interpersonal relations, relations between human beings and society, as well as between human beings and nature. Nowadays, harmonious development is still the way of running the country and managing talented personnel. With the development of China’s society, economy and culture, the idea of “harmony” goes even deeper into people’s hearts. China is on its way toward the goal of building a harmonious socialist society.

College life and high school life differ in many ways. High school offers fundamental courses such as math, physics and English, whereas college offers more specialized courses, most of which are related to students’ majors. In high school, all classes are arranged by the school, so students just follow a fixed schedule; in contrast, college students can choose the courses in which they are interested and arrange their own schedule, so their schedule is more flexible. Moreover, high school students acquire knowledge and skills mainly through teacher’s instructions. In contrast, besides attending lectures, college students are expected to learn on their own, and develop critical thinking.
